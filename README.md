## About The Project

![PriceTracker](https://res.cloudinary.com/mayur28/image/upload/v1681217885/PriceTrackerResponsive_oljyzt.png))

As you have already know from my [portfolio](https://www.mayuragarwal.in/) that my focussed is on creating the user-friendly websites that deliver over the top experience. It delivers clean and easy-to-use user-experience with excellent responsiveness. Some key points which I keep in mind while developing the projects:

- Must provide clean and easy-to-use experience.
- Must provide better responsiveness for all screen sizes.

### Features

- Built a full-stack web app to buy the products at minimum price and also provides attractive and user-friendly interface.
- Added the paste the link feature which provides ease of use.
- Added the chart to provide easy way to know the history of prices for that product.
- Used React.js, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
- Utilized Ant-Design for better visualization.
